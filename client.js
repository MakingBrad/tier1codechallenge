  // Write your code here!

  // 1. Start with the number 29 and set that equal to a variable named ‘highScore’;
  
  // 2. Make a new empty array called myScrabbleTiles.
  
  // 3. Put these 6 tile objects into myScrabbleTiles:
  /*
    { tile: 'N', score: 1 }
    { tile: 'K', score: 5 }
    { tile: 'Z', score: 10 }
    { tile: 'X', score: 8 }
    { tile: 'D', score: 2 }
    { tile: 'A', score: 1 }
  */
  
  // 4. Remove the last tile from myScrabbleTiles.
  
  // 5. Add the following new tile to myScrabbleTiles:
  /*
    { tile: 'F', score : 4 }
  */
  
  // 6. Write a function that takes in an array. The function will use a for-loop and returns the sum of all the scores in the given array.
  
  // 7. Use the function above to get the total score for myScrabbleTiles and assign the value to a variable called "myScore".
  
  // 8. Check whether or not your score is higher than the highScore.
    // 8-1 If your score is higher, change highScore to the new high score.
  
  
// STRETCH GOALS!!! 
  
  // 9. Using jQuery, Append to the DOM the highScore value.
  
  // 10. Using jQuery, Append to the DOM myScrabbleTiles as an unordered list

});
// DO NOT WRITE CODE BEYOND HERE
